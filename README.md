## Diagrid Catalyst

Diagrid Catalyst is a suite of unified APIs for messaging, data and workflow. Catalyst frees developers from the fragmentation of code sprawl, infrastructure lock-in and ever-increasing security vulnerabilities. The APIs, which are based on the popular Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) open source project [Dapr](https://dapr.io/), enable developers to drastically reduce boilerplate code and can be used from any cloud and with existing infrastructure.

Catalyst APIs are cloud-hosted and entirely consumption-based, implementing industry-standard patterns for workflow orchestration, Request/Response communication, Publish/Subscribe messaging, Connectors to external systems and Key/Value state management.
